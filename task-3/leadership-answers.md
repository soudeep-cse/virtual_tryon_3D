## AI Engineer Onboarding Plan

**Goal:** Onboard a new AI engineer to become productive within 2 weeks.

### Before They Start:
1. **Laptop Setup**: Pre-configure their laptop, install required software, and create necessary accounts.
2. **Assign a Buddy**: Pair the new hire with an experienced team member to answer questions.
3. **Prepare First Task**: Set a simple first task to be completed within the first few days.

### Week 1: Learning & Setup
- **Day 1**: 
  - Office tour
  - Meet the team
  - Understand current AI projects and their importance.
  
- **Day 2**: 
  - Walkthrough of the codebase.
  - Review AI models and data pipeline.
  
- **Day 3**: 
  - Shadow a senior engineer during model training to learn the workflow.

- **Day 4**: 
  - Review deployment tools and processes used in the team.

- **Day 5**: 
  - Resolve a small bug or improve existing documentation to get them involved with the code.

### Week 2: Real Work
- **Day 6-7**: 
  - Work on a medium task, such as improving the accuracy of a model or adding a feature to the pipeline.
  
- **Day 8-10**: 
  - Take ownership of a small feature and work independently.

- **Daily Check-ins**: 
  - Short 15-minute daily check-ins to provide feedback and answer any questions.

### Key Success Factors:
- **Clear Expectations**: By Day 10, they should be able to independently train and deploy a model.
- **Documentation**: Ensure README files and setup guides are comprehensive and easy to follow.
- **Patience**: Encourage questions, and make learning from mistakes a part of the process.
- **Quick Wins**: Provide tasks that can be completed successfully to build confidence.

**Expected Outcome:**
- The new hire will become a productive contributor within 2 weeks instead of struggling for months.

## Fixing Repeated Deployment Errors in AI Pipeline

**Goal:** Fix repeated deployment errors in the AI pipeline and make the deployment process more reliable.

### Step 1: Find the Root Problems
- **Review Previous Errors**: Analyze the last 20 deployment failures to identify common issues.
- **Team Feedback**: Ask the team about the most common and annoying deployment issues.
- **Common Problems Identified**: 
  - Missing dependencies
  - Wrong configurations
  - Manual steps that could be automated

### Step 2: Create a Standard Process
- **Automated Testing**: Ensure all models pass accuracy and speed tests before deployment.
- **Deployment Checklist**: Create a simple checklist for everyone to follow before deployment.
- **Docker Containers**: Standardize environments using Docker containers across all stages (dev, staging, production).
- **One-Click Deploy**: Automate manual steps to simplify deployment.

#### Example Simple Process:
1. Developer commits code.
2. Automated tests run (typically take 5 minutes).
3. If tests pass, automatically deploy to staging.
4. Manual approval required before deployment to production.
5. Monitor production deployment for 30 minutes. If issues arise, rollback.

### Step 3: Train the Team
- **Live Demo**: Show the team the new deployment process with a live demo.
- **Pair Programming**: Pair a senior engineer with a junior engineer to help with the first few deployments.
- **Documentation**: Update the internal documentation with a step-by-step guide on the new process.

### Step 4: Track Improvements
- **Measure Success**: Track the number of successful vs. failed deployments.
- **Weekly Check-ins**: Ask the team how deployments went during the week and identify any challenges.
- **Continuous Improvement**: Regularly update the deployment process based on feedback.

### Key Result:
- Deployment failures drop from 30% to under 5%.
- The team spends less time fixing deployment issues.
- Everyone follows the same reliable deployment process.
- New team members can deploy confidently without issues.

### Key Principle:
**Make the right way the easy way.** If the standard process is harder than doing it manually, people will not adopt it.
