# SaaS Virtual Try-On Platform

## Overview

**Problem:** Online glasses/hat shops face challenges with providing a virtual try-on solution. Building this solution from scratch is expensive and complex.

**Our SaaS Solution:** A shared platform where multiple shop owners can sign up, upload their products, and offer virtual try-on to their customers. Think of it like "Shopify for Virtual Try-On."

### How it works:
1. **Shop Owner** creates an account.
2. Uploads **glasses/hat** with 3D models.
3. **Customers** visit the shop's try-on page.
4. Real-time **face detection** and **product overlay** on the customer's face.
5. Customer makes a **purchase decision**.

### Features:
- **Multi-Tenant Architecture**
  - Each shop gets its own dashboard, products, and customer data.
  - Shared resources to reduce costs.
  - Scalable billing based on usage (e.g., number of try-ons, storage).
  - White-label solution allowing customization of the try-on widget.

## CI/CD & MLOps Pipeline

### How we deploy code:
1. Developer writes and pushes code to **GitHub**.
2. Auto-testing process starts.
3. Code moves to **Staging**.
4. Code is deployed to **Production**.

### AI Model Management:
1. **Train** new face detection models.
2. **Test** on sample data.
3. **Gradual Roll-out**: Start with 5%, then 50%, and then 100% users.
4. Keep **backup models** for quick rollback if needed.
5. **Monitor performance** and switch to a backup model if necessary.

### Tools:
- **GitHub Actions** for deployment automation.
- **MLflow** for model management.
- **Docker** containers for environment consistency.

## Cost Optimization

### Smart Storage:
- **New uploads** use **fast SSD** storage.
- After 30 days, files move to **cheaper storage**.
- After 90 days, files are archived in **very cheap storage**.

### GPU Cost Savings:
- **Auto-scaling GPU servers** based on demand.
- Use **spot instances** (cheaper) when possible.
- Share GPU resources across multiple users.
- **Cache popular models** to avoid reloading.

### CDN & Caching:
- **Store 3D models** closer to users globally.
- **Cache frequently used items** in memory.
- **Preload models** that users are likely to try.

## Monitoring & Auto-scaling

### Monitoring Metrics:
- **Face detection speed** (target: under 100ms).
- **Product overlay success rate** (target: 95%+).
- **Server performance** and **costs**.
- **User experience metrics** (e.g., load times).

### Auto-scaling Strategy:
- **User growth** → Automatically add more servers.
- **Peak hours** → Pre-scale before demand hits.
- **Global usage patterns** → Scale based on different time zones.

### Alerts:
- **Critical:** Service down, face detection failure.
- **Warning:** Slow response times, high costs.
- **Info:** Daily usage reports.

## Security & Reliability

### Data Protection:
- **Face data** is never permanently stored.
- **Data encryption** during transfer and storage.
- **Shop data isolation**: Each shop’s data is isolated.
- **GDPR compliance**: Users can delete their data anytime.

### System Reliability:
- **99.9% uptime** guarantee.
- **Automatic daily backups**.
- In case of server failure, others take over.
- **Multiple data centers** for disaster recovery.

### Access Control:
- Shop owners can only access their own data.
- **Rate limits** prevent system abuse.
- **Multi-factor authentication** for shop owner accounts.

## Concurrent User Handling

### The Challenge:
During peak hours (weekends, holidays), thousands of shoppers may try on products at the same time.

### Our Solution:
- **Horizontal scaling**: Automatically spin up more servers when traffic increases.
- **AI model sharing**: Same face detection model serves all tenants.
- **Smart queuing**: If GPU resources are fully utilized, queue requests with estimated wait times.
- **Geographic distribution**: Deploy servers in multiple regions for global shops.

### Real-world Scenario (Black Friday with 10,000 users):
- Load balancer distributes traffic across **50+ servers**.
- **10 GPU instances** handle the face detection workload.
- **CDN** serves 3D models from the closest location.
- **Redis cache** reduces database load by **80%**.

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1 (3 months):
- Build a basic platform with core features like account creation, product upload, and virtual try-on.

### Phase 2 (6 months):
- Implement advanced AI features, auto-scaling, and improve security.

### Phase 3 (12 months):
- Global deployment and introduce enterprise features.

## Conclusion

This platform can handle thousands of concurrent users, provides sub-100ms response times, and scales automatically based on demand while keeping costs optimized.
